# BankBranch
<br /> An example program on processes and threads
<br /> Simulatation of a bank branch which has multiple pay desks and
associated queues. Bank clients will arrive and enter a pay deskâ€™s queue. When they are at the
front, they will spend some time to do their banking transaction and leave. When they leave,
the desk will inform the supervisor about the payment.
Each desk will be represented by a thread. The clients will be generated by the main thread
and the supervisor will also be represented by a thread.
In order to change the parameters of the program, command-line options should be used.
